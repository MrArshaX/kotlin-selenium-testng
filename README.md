# KotlinSeleniumTestNgExample
That was my first experience using `Kotlin` and was surprisingly good!

This mini-project just create a random Outlook account with automation, but there is a confirmation step (captcha or sms) that needs to be done manually.

Anyway, I think it's a good starting point for testing kotlin or selenium

## Resources
- Selenium Webdriver
- TestNg
- Kotlin

## Building
- use IntelliJ
- import maven dependencies (pom.xml)
- run tests _*~yay!*_

no complications, just download and run.

I am no expert in any of these frameworks / language, so don't expect too much, I did this just for training kotlin, selenium and of course, for fun.  (:

feel free to propose changes or ask me help ok?
